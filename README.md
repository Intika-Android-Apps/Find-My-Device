# FindMyDevice

Find your Device via SMS.
This applications goal is to track your device when it's lost and should be a secure open source application and a alternative to Googles FindMyDevice.

# Why?

I have lost my  brand new phone last week.
I have to say, if i would have used Googles Services like (FindMyDevice) i could have a better chance to find it.
But why the heck did nobody created an open source application to find a lost device without giving up your privacy and feeding the big data crake Google.
