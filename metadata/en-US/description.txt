FindMyDevice

This application can locate your smartphone when it gets lost.


Hello,
just for explanation. I lost my new phone.
And cause i don't use the Google-Services i couldn't locate it and so i was f*****.
In hope that this doesn't happen again, i developed this application, that can locate the smartphone via sms.
After installed, you can enter some numbers into that whitelist that can locate you.
Just send a sms with fmd to receive the syntax how to locate the phone.

Features:

- Locate the phone via SMS
- Lock the Phone
- Let the phone ring
- Delete the phone

Planned Features:

- Recognize networks that are near the phone
- Locate the phone without gps ort network

I still couldn't afford a new phone.
So if you want to help i am very happy about donations.

CAVE:
This application is still in beta.
If this app doesn't work, it's not my fault, it's the fault of the holy satan and the missing lines that weren't on the right spot.
I try my best to develop the app, but i still have to work regularry.
So sorry, if it didn't worked out.
