    <string name="Introduction">FMD is an application that can help you find your phone when it gets lost.\nIt uses SMS (texting) to communicate. You need to have a second device or a friend so you can track your phone.\nJust write a SNS that contains the "fmd" command.\nStill in beta.\n\n - Nulide</string>

    <string name="About_Text">Thanks for downloading this app!\nThere is still a lot to do, but I hope this app will help you if you find yourself in the same situation I had. Losing your phone is bad, but losing your phone because there are no privacy-friendly apps to help you find it is even worse.\nContributions and donations are welcome! Just go to F-Droid and search for my app.\n\n - Nulide</string>
